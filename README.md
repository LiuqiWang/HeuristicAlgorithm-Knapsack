# HeuristicAlgorithm-Knapsack
Write the Knapsack algorithm that will pack the most value in a limited space

Steps:
1. run knapsack.sql in MySQL
2. run KnapsackDev1.py

Note: 
load_knapsack function is written in KnapsackV5.py. 
The function is imported into KnapsackDev1.py

Note: KnapsackDev1.py file provided by Dr. Bradley, my solution for function load_knapsack is in KnapsackV5.py
